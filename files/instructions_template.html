    Give these slips to your students, if a student isn't present keep their slip with you
    (So if someone comes looking for this student you can give them their next slip).
    Once found, a student must give all their collected slips to their finder.
    <span style="font-weight: 600">Students must keep all slips with them throughout the week!</span>
    Good luck! :)
