# Rutherford Mayhem

In 2015 Rutherford College played a school-wide game called _mayhem_, where every student got a card with another students name. Once they found this person they stole their card, all other cards they've collected, and continue finding the next person. The student with the most cards at the end wins.

Inspired by this, in 2019 we replayed this game and I was in charge of organizing it, so here's the code for generating these cards. It takes a *csv input file* of all the students in the school and some info of them like their name and ID (this file was provided by a teacher of the school), and outputs a printable PDF of all the cards.

## Hey my school plays this game too!

Do they? Awesome! So far I've only heard of one other school that does something like this, so if you know what the game's actually called or have any other information about the game, contact me

## Uhhh, yeah how do I use this?
